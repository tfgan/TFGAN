# TFGAN

This code implements **TFGAN**, a variant of **FinGAN** enhanced by incorporating topological data features of financial time series. In this project, topology is represented as a differentiable tensor and integrated directly into the GAN loss function.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Virtual environment (recommended)

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Preparation

- Prepare your input data in the required format.
- Place your data files in the data/ directory.

## Usage

Run the example script for FinGAN (now TFGAN-enabled):

```bash
python FinGAN-example.py
